# Aptivate Generic Intranet

This is a basic intranet application, written in Django.

It's intended to be easily extensible, and made from reusable
components.

Standard components are expected to include:

* Document library with content indexing and searching
* User profiles and permissions
* User directory (to find and contact users)

It may eventually include calendar, blog and wiki modules as well.
